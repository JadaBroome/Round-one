### Flexbox Practice

This exercise is meant to be freeform. You will see that there is an HTML file `index.html` which should contain all the semantic markup you need to be able to use CSS to style and position the content. How you lay it out is up to you. Use your creativity. `index.css` already has the Eric Meyer CSS reset in it.

Lambda School's Git workflow:

`click arrow to expand for details`

<details>
<summary>1. Fork the repo to create YOUR OWN version of the project</summary>

</details>

<details>
   <summary>2. Add your PM as a collaborator</summary>

on GitHub:
Settings -> Collaborators -> Add Collaborator (use your PM’s handle)
(I’d suggest grabbing the invite tag and DM it to your PM on Slack at this point)

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Clone YOUR Repo</summary>

In your terminal/Git-Bash: `git clone your-repo-address`

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Create a branch</summary>
This will be the branch you will do all your work on.

In your terminal/Git-Bash:

`cd name-of-project-folder`

`git checkout -b firstname-lastname`

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Open the project in VS Code and begin work.</summary>

Windows or Linux users:

In terminal/Git-Bash, type `code .` while inside the project folder

Mac users:

1. In VS Code.
1. Open File menu.
1. Select `add folder to workspace`
1. Navigate to, and then select the project folder.
1. Click open.
   </details>

<details>
<summary>6. Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch</summary>
Still in your terminal/Git-Bash:

`git push -u origin firstname-lastname`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
7. On the GitHub page for the project repo, follow these steps.
</summary>

1. You should see a light yellow box which shows your push.
1. In that box, click the green button labeled `Compare & Pull Request`
1. In the Open Pull Request form, set the base to `YOUR MASTER` (NOT the Lambda Master)
1. Set the compare to `YOUR FORK` (NOT your master)
1. Add your PM as a reviewer by clicking `reviewer` from the righthand menu.

On the ‘Open a Pull Request‘ page click on Reviewers. If your PM has accepted your invite, then you should be able to select them here. If not, then they haven’t accepted the invite, and come back later…

Your PM will merge the work into YOUR Master fork when they have reviewed and approved it.
